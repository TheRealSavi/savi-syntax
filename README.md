# savi-syntax theme

My version of the tinacious-design-syntax. Dark and colorful. :)

Easy on the eyes and lets you focus on what is most important in your code
Allows you to easily discern the different elements of your code while remaining stunning and beautiful

Definitely not boring and definitely fun.
Have a good time :)
